                                                                  OFFSITE BACKUP
================================================================================
Offsite backup is a collection of scripts that wraps the RDiffBackup program
into a more complete backup solution. It features prepare scripts (e.g. to dump
MySQL databases).

                                                                    DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The runtime dependencies are:
 - rdiff-backup
 - python-pylibacl
 - python-pyxattr

When building, only debhelper is required.

                                                              BUILDING  PACKAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run 'dpkg-buildpackage' in the root of this directory. This creates 3 packages:
  - offsite-backup
  - local-backup
  - backup-scripts

The first two contain the scripts to start rdiffbackup, the first one allows to
backup to a remote server, where the second one (local-backup) backups to a
local directory (possibly on an NFS-share). The backup-scripts package contains
serveral prepare scripts. These should be symlinked from their installation di-
rectory (/usr/share//backup-scripts/prepare/) to /etc/backup/prepare.d/. These
script are then run before the backup is initiated.

                                                                           USING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Install either local- or offsite-backup.
 - Symlink the needed prepare scripts.
 - Configure it:
  o /etc/backup/{includes,excludes} to in- and exclude files and directories
  o /etc/backup/{offsite,local}-backup.conf (should be self-explanatory)
 - It is cronned by default, by you can run it by hand.

                                                                         LICENSE
