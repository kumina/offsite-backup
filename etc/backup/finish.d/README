This directory contains scripts which need to be run after the backup
has completed.  Scripts are run with run-parts(8).

To enable a script, link it from /usr/share/offsite-backup or create your own
script here and make it executable.  Analogously, to disable a script, remove
the link if it's a link, or remove the executable bit from the file permissions
if it's a custom script.
